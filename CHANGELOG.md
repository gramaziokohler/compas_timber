## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

* Reduced some boilerplate code in `Joint` subclasses.
* Added argument `beams` to `Joint.__init__()` which expects tuple containing beams from implementing class instance.

### Removed

* Removed `joint_type` attributes from all `Joint` classes.
* Removed argument `cutoff` from `LMiterJoint` as it was not used anywhere.
* Removed argument `gap` from `TButtJoint` as it was not used anywhere.
* Removed argument `gap` from `FrenchRidgeLap` as it was not used anywhere.
* Removed class `JointOptions` as not used anymore.

## [0.7.0] 2024-02-15

### Added

* Added `debug_geometries` attribute to `BeamJoiningError`.
* (Re)added `BooleanSubtraction` feature.
* Added flag `modify_cross` to `L-Butt` joint.
* Added flag `reject_i` to `L-Butt` joint.
* Added new `NullJoint`.
* Added `mill_depth` argument to butt joints, with geometric representation of milled recess in cross beam.
* Added `ButtJoint` class with methods common to `LButtJoint` and `TButtJoint`
* Added new `L_TopologyJointRule`, `T_TopologyJointRule`, `X_TopologyJointRule` GH components
* Added GH component param support functions in `compas_timber.ghpython.ghcomponent_helpers.py`
* Added `topos` attribute to `CategoryRule` to filter when joints get applied

### Changed

* `BeamFromCurve` GH component accepts now referenced Rhino curves, referenced Rhino object IDs and internalized lines.
* `BeamFromCurve` GH component accepts now referenced Rhino curves, referenced Rhino object IDs and internalized lines.
* Fixed `FeatureError` when L-Butt applies the cutting plane.
* Fixed T-Butt doesn't get extended to cross beam's plane.
* `SimpleSequenceGenerator` updated to work with `compas.datastructures.assembly` and generates building plan acording to type.
* Changed GH Categories for joint rules.
* Made `beam_side_incident` a `staticmethod` of `Joint` and reworked it.
* Extended `DecomposeBeam` component to optionally show beam frame and faces.
* Changed `CategoryJointRule` and `DirectJointRule` to a dynamic interface where joint type is selected with right click menu
* Changed `Assembly` GH component to apply category joints if the detected topology is in `CategoryRule.topos`
* Changed `TopologyJoints` GH component to `DefaultJoints` Component, which applies default joints based on topology. 

### Removed

* Removed component `ShowBeamFrame`.
* Changed GH Categories for joint rules
* `BrepGeometryConsumer` continues to apply features even after the first error.
* `DrillHole` component calculates length from input line.
* `DrillHole` has default diameter proportional to beam cross-section.
* Removed input `Length` from `DrillHole` component.
* Fixed broken `TrimmingFeature` component.
* Removed all `JointOption` components. these are accessed in context menu of joint rules.
