`compas_timber` is a user-friendly open-source software toolkit to streamline the design of timber frame structures. Despite its advances in digitalization compared to other building techniques, timber construction is often perceived as a challenging field, involving intricate processes in design, planning, coordination, and fabrication. We aim to increase the use of timber in architecture by lowering the threshold of creating versatile and resource-aware designs.
