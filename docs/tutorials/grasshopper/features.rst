Jack Rafter Cut Feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: ../images/Features_JackRafter.png
  :width: 100%

|
**JackRafterCut** feature cuts beam with a plane. The part of the beam lying on the *z-positive* side of the plane will be removed.

* `Beam` : the beam to be trimmed.
* `Plane` : the plane to trim the beam as a surface.

.. note::

    **Plene angle**

    Angle between the cutting plane and the beam axis must be > 0.01 and < 179.9.

Double Cut Feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: ../images/Features_DoubleCut.png
  :width: 100%

|
**DoubleCut** feature cuts beam with two planes. The part of the beam lying on the *z-positive* sides of both planes will be removed.

* `Beam` : the beam to be trimmed.
* `Plane_a` : the first plane to trim the beam as a surface.
* `Plane_b` : the second plane to trim the beam as a surface.

Drilling Feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: ../images/Features_Drilling.png
  :width: 100%

|
**Drilling** feature  is a boolean operation to subtract a cylindrical hole from a beam.

* `Beam` : the beam to be drilled.
* `Line` : the axis of the hole as a line
* `Diameter` : the diameter of the hole

The output `Feature` is to be used as input for the **Model** component. See :doc:`model`.
