class LButtJoint(ButtJoint):
    """Represents an L-Butt type joint which joins two beam in their ends, trimming the main beam.

    This joint type is compatible with beams in L topology.

    Please use `LButtJoint.create()` to properly create an instance of this class and associate it with a model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    main_beam : :class:`~compas_timber.parts.Beam`
        The main beam to be joined.
    cross_beam : :class:`~compas_timber.parts.Beam`
        The cross beam to be joined.
    mill_depth : float
        The depth of the pocket to be milled in the cross beam.
    small_beam_butts : bool, default False
        If True, the beam with the smaller cross-section will be trimmed. Otherwise, the main beam will be trimmed.
    modify_cross : bool, default False
        If True, the cross beam will be extended to the opposite face of the main beam and cut with the same plane.
    reject_i : bool, default False
        If True, the joint will reject beams in I topology.

    Attributes
    ----------
    main_beam : :class:`~compas_timber.parts.Beam`
        The main beam to be joined.
    cross_beam : :class:`~compas_timber.parts.Beam`
        The cross beam to be joined.
    mill_depth : float
        The depth of the pocket to be milled in the cross beam.
    small_beam_butts : bool, default False
        If True, the beam with the smaller cross-section will be trimmed. Otherwise, the main beam will be trimmed.
    modify_cross : bool, default False
        If True, the cross beam will be extended to the opposite face of the main beam and cut with the same plane.
    reject_i : bool, default False
        If True, the joint will reject beams in I topology.
