class XHalfLapJoint(LapJoint):
    """Represents a X-Lap type joint which joins the end of a beam along the length of another beam,
    trimming the main beam.

    This joint type is compatible with beams in T topology.

    Please use `XHalfLapJoint.create()` to properly create an instance of this class and associate it with an assembly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    main_beam : :class:`~compas_timber.parts.Beam`
        The main beam to be joined.
    cross_beam : :class:`~compas_timber.parts.Beam`
        The cross beam to be joined.
    flip_lap_side : bool
        If True, the lap is flipped to the other side of the beams.
    cut_plane_bias : float
        Allows lap to be shifted deeper into one beam or the other. Value should be between 0 and 1.0 without completely cutting through either beam. Default is 0.5.
