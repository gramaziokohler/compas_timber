    Parameters
    ----------
    line : [point, point] | :class:`~compas.geometry.Line`
        Two points defining the line.
    plane : [point, vector] | :class:`~compas.geometry.Plane`

    tol : float, optional
        A tolerance for membership verification.
    Returns
    -------
    [float, float, float] | None
        The intersection point between the line and the plane,
        or None if the line and the plane are parallel.
