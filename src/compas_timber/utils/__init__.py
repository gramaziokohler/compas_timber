def intersection_line_line_3D(line1, line2, max_distance=1e-6, limit_to_segments=True, tol=1e-6):
    """Find, if exists, the intersection point of `line1` and `line2` and returns parametric information about it.

    For each of the lines, the point of intersection and a `t` parameter are returned.

    The `t` parameter is the normalized parametric value (0.0 -> 1.0) of the location of the intersection point
    in relation to the line's starting point.
    0.0 indicates intersaction near the starting point, 1.0 indicates intersection near the end.

    If no intersection is detected within the max_distance, or the intersection falls outside either of the line segments,
    [None, None], [None, None] is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line1 : :class:`~compas.geometry.Line`
        First line.
    line2 : :class:`~compas.geometry.Line`
        Second line.
    max_distance : float
        Maximum distance between the lines to still consider as intersection.
    limit_to_segments : bool, defualt is True
        If True, the lines are considered intersection only if the intersection point falls whithin the given line segments for both lines.
    tol : float, default is 1e-6
        The tolerance used for floating point operations.
